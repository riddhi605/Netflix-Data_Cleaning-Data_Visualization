# Netflix-Data_Cleaning-Data_Visualization
Netflix is a popular streaming service that offers a vast catalog of movies, TV shows, and original contents. This
dataset is a cleaned version of the original version which can be found here. The data consist of contents added to
Netflix from 2008 to 2021. The oldest content is as old as 1925 and the newest as 2021. This dataset will be
cleaned with PostgreSQL and visualized with Tableau. The purpose of this dataset is to test my data cleaning and
visualization skills.
